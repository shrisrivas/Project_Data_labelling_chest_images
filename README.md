# Project_Data_labelling_chest_images  
Task: Chest X-Ray images play a vital role in the diagnosis of diseases. In this assignment, you will be in-charge of the task of Chest X-Ray Classification into 3 categories Covid, Normal, and Pneumonia. 
                                                            





Dataset: As part of this assignment, you are provided with the Chest X-Ray dataset with one zip file having 900 images (300 images per class). 
Problems: 
1. Fine-tune a pre-trained Image Classification model of your choice by using 80% data as the training set and 20% as the test set. Please feel free to use any Fine-Tuning approach to solve this problem.
 2. In the real-world, labelling the entire raw dataset can be quite expensive. In such cases, semi supervised/few-shot image classification research papers and models can be your ally! For this problem, please do your own Literature Review and choose a suitable research paper to implement using just 20 images per class as the training set and evaluate your modelâ€™s performance on the entire dataset of 900 images.
Notes:
1. Please use either Tensor Flow/Keras or PyTorch.
2. For evaluation, please report the Accuracy, F1 Score (Micro) and F1 Score (Macro) on the Test Set.
